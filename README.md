        1. Building NavBar Using createNav() function that executed by for loop .

    	  2. While i run createNav() Function it's contain createSection() Funtion  because each section and nav take one variable number because I create section by Javascript.

        3. Adding active class in addEventListener while scroll to each section on viewport by using offSetTop for each section then get pageYOffset

        3. create 2 Functions scrollToSec() & activeLink() and then run them in forEach of menuList (list of Anchor Tag)

        4. Adding Function to display none the Navbar according to user interaction with a webpage by using the setTimeOut Method.

        5. Building a to-top Button appended to the page while window.scrollY > 400 px and it's fixed of the right bottom og the webpage to be easy for the user to click on it to go to the top of the page.

	      6. Sections collapsible are made by clicking of each section to toggle collapsed class by using collapse().
